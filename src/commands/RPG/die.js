      Failure means you fall unconscious
      (or simply stop working, if you

      the first place); see Recovering from
      Unconsciousness (p. 423). Success

      functioning. Exception: If you
      choose Do Nothing on your turn,
      and do not attempt any defense
      rolls, you can remain conscious
      without rolling. Roll only on turns

      and collapse). Roll again each time
      you suffer injury equal to a further
      multiple of your HP, whether as a
      result of one wound or many. For
      instance, if you have 11 HP, you
      must roll to avoid death at -11 HP.

      arrow wounds leave a messy but

      fire injury leaves nothing but an unrecognizable lump of charcoal.
